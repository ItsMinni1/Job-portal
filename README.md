This Job-portal application is designed to simulate a real-world job search and recruitment system. Users can register as job seekers or employers, log in securely, and perform role-based actions. Employers can create, manage, and review job postings. Job seekers can search jobs, apply to listings, and view application status. Administrative controls are supported where applicable. The project uses a client–server architecture.
